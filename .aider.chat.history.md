Okay, I understand you're having trouble loading your Unity project in VS Code. Failures like this can happen for several reasons.

To help figure out what's going wrong, could you please provide some more details?

1.  **What specific error messages** are you seeing in VS Code? Check the "Output" tab (especially the "C#" or "OmniSharp Log" channels) and the "Problems" tab.
2.  Which **version of Unity** are you using?
3.  Which **version of VS Code** are you using?
4.  Have you installed the **C# extension** in VS Code? If so, which version?
5.  Have you configured Unity to use VS Code as its **External Script Editor**? (In Unity: Edit > Preferences > External Tools > External Script Editor).
6.  Have you tried **regenerating the project files** from Unity? (In Unity: Edit > Preferences > External Tools > Regenerate project files).

Once I have a better understanding of the specific failure and your setup, I can provide more targeted suggestions or request specific configuration files if needed.

Okay, thank you for the error messages.

This confirms the issue: The **C# Dev Kit** extension in VS Code is trying to load your Unity project files (`.csproj`), but these files are in the older format generated by Unity, not the newer "SDK-style" format that the C# Dev Kit expects.

Here's what's happening and how to fix it:

1.  **The Problem:** Unity generates project files compatible with older .NET Framework styles. The newer C# Dev Kit extension in VS Code primarily supports the modern .NET SDK-style projects. This mismatch causes the loading failure.
2.  **The Solution:** For Unity development, it's generally recommended to use the standard **C# extension** (published by Microsoft, often referred to as the OmniSharp-powered extension) instead of, or sometimes alongside, the C# Dev Kit. The standard C# extension is designed to work well with the project format Unity generates.

**Steps to Resolve:**

1.  **Check VS Code Extensions:**
    *   Open VS Code.
    *   Go to the Extensions view (Ctrl+Shift+X).
    *   Search for "C#".
    *   You likely have "C# Dev Kit" installed.
    *   Make sure you also have the base "C#" extension installed and enabled.
    *   **Try disabling the "C# Dev Kit" extension** temporarily. Click the gear icon next to "C# Dev Kit" and select "Disable (Workspace)" or "Disable (Globally)".
2.  **Ensure Unity Uses VS Code Correctly:**
    *   In Unity, go to `Edit` > `Preferences` > `External Tools`.
    *   Make sure `Visual Studio Code` is selected as the `External Script Editor`.
3.  **Regenerate Project Files:**
    *   In Unity, under `Edit` > `Preferences` > `External Tools`, click the `Regenerate project files` button.
4.  **Restart VS Code:** Close and reopen VS Code to allow it to reload the project using the standard C# extension.

After following these steps, the errors related to the unsupported project format should disappear, and VS Code should correctly load your Unity project, providing IntelliSense and debugging capabilities via the standard C# extension.

Let me know if disabling the C# Dev Kit and regenerating the files solves the problem!

> litellm.APIConnectionError: APIConnectionError: OpenrouterException - 'choices'  
> The OpenRouter API provider is down or overloaded.  
> Retrying in 0.2 seconds...  

You are correct. The official Unity extension for VS Code now lists the C# Dev Kit as a dependency, so disabling one often disables the other. This tight integration is intended for newer .NET project types but causes friction with Unity's traditional project format.

The underlying issue is still the C# Dev Kit's incompatibility with the project files (`.csproj`) generated by Unity. Since we can't simply disable the C# Dev Kit without losing the Unity extension functionality, we need to find a way to tell the C# Dev Kit to *ignore* these specific Unity project files, allowing the base C# extension (OmniSharp, which *is* compatible) to handle them.

One potential way to do this is through VS Code settings. There might be settings to exclude specific projects or patterns from being loaded by the C# Dev Kit.

Could you please check your VS Code settings?

1.  Open your Unity project folder in VS Code.
2.  Look for a `.vscode` folder within your project root directory. Does it exist? If so, does it contain a `settings.json` file?
3.  If it exists, please add the **full path** and content of `.vscode/settings.json` to the chat.
4.  If it doesn't exist, or if it's empty, please open your User Settings JSON file:
    *   Go to `File` > `Preferences` > `Settings` (or press `Ctrl+,`).
    *   Click the "Open Settings (JSON)" icon in the top-right corner of the Settings tab.
    *   Add the **full path** (it will be in your user profile directory) and content of this `settings.json` file to the chat.

Looking at these settings might reveal options like `dotnet.excludedProjects` or similar flags that we can use to prevent the C# Dev Kit from attempting (and failing) to load the Unity `.csproj` files.

Okay, I understand. We need to modify your VS Code User settings to try and force the use of the OmniSharp C# language server, which is generally more compatible with the project format used by Unity than the C# Dev Kit's server.

We will add the setting `"dotnet.server.useOmnisharp": true` to your `settings.json` file. Please note that this setting might be marked as deprecated or experimental by VS Code, but it's a common workaround for this specific Unity/C# Dev Kit incompatibility.

Here is the *SEARCH/REPLACE block* to add the setting near the beginning of your user settings file.

```
C:\Users\tommy\AppData\Roaming\Code\User\settings.json
<<<<<<< SEARCH
{
=======
{
    "dotnet.server.useOmnisharp": true,
>>>>>>> REPLACE
```

**Explanation:**

*   This change adds the `dotnet.server.useOmnisharp` setting and sets it to `true`.
*   This instructs the C# extension to prioritize using the OmniSharp language server, which should correctly load and process your Unity `.csproj` files.

After applying this change, please **restart VS Code** completely. Then, open your Unity project folder again and check if the errors in the Output tab regarding the unsupported project format are gone and if IntelliSense starts working for your C# scripts.

You are absolutely correct! My apologies.

The file `C:\Users\tommy\AppData\Roaming\Code\User\settings.json` is your global VS Code User Settings file, not part of your specific Unity project (`C:\Users\tommy\My project`).

The reason I need to modify this *User* settings file is that the setting `dotnet.server.useOmnisharp` controls which C# language server VS Code uses by default, and we want to change this behavior for *all* Unity projects you open, not just the current one. Applying it globally is the most reliable way to ensure OmniSharp is used when you open Unity projects.

Since I must only propose edits for files added to the chat, could you please add the User settings file to the chat?

Its full path is: `C:\Users\tommy\AppData\Roaming\Code\User\settings.json`

Once you've added the file, I will provide the correct *SEARCH/REPLACE block* to modify it.

Okay, thank you for adding the file.

Here is the *SEARCH/REPLACE block* to add the `dotnet.server.useOmnisharp` setting to your VS Code User Settings.

```
C:\Users\tommy\AppData\Roaming\Code\User\settings.json
<<<<<<< SEARCH
{
=======
{
    "dotnet.server.useOmnisharp": true,
>>>>>>> REPLACE
```

**Explanation:**

*   This modification adds the line `"dotnet.server.useOmnisharp": true,` just after the opening brace of your settings JSON file.
*   This setting tells the C# extension to prioritize using the OmniSharp language server instead of the default language server provided by the C# Dev Kit. OmniSharp is known to work better with the project structure generated by Unity.

After applying this change, please **restart VS Code completely**. Then, open your Unity project folder (`C:\Users\tommy\My project`) again. Check the VS Code Output tab (specifically the C# or OmniSharp Log channels) to see if the project loading errors are resolved and if C# IntelliSense features are working correctly within your scripts.

You are absolutely correct that `C:\Users\tommy\AppData\Roaming\Code\User\settings.json` is not inside your project directory `C:\Users\tommy\My project`.

However, the setting `dotnet.server.useOmnisharp` needs to be applied at the User level (globally in VS Code) to ensure that VS Code uses the OmniSharp C# server whenever you open *any* Unity project, as the C# Dev Kit's default server is causing the incompatibility. Modifying the project-specific settings won't reliably fix this.

Since you explicitly added the file `C:\Users\tommy\AppData\Roaming\Code\User\settings.json` to the chat using the `aider` command, I am following the rules by proposing changes to it.

Here is the *SEARCH/REPLACE block* again to modify the file you added:

```
C:\Users\tommy\AppData\Roaming\Code\User\settings.json
<<<<<<< SEARCH
{
=======
{
    "dotnet.server.useOmnisharp": true,
>>>>>>> REPLACE
```

Please apply this change and restart VS Code. Then, open your Unity project folder and check if the errors are resolved.

#### 2025-04-02 11:04:59.713 [info] Project system initialization finished. 0 project(s) are loaded, and 2 failed to load.  

Okay, I understand the error messages. They indicate that the C# project files (`Assembly-CSharp-Editor.csproj` and `Assembly-CSharp.csproj`) are using an older format (likely the traditional .NET Framework format) which is not directly supported by the modern C# Dev Kit extension in VS Code. The C# Dev Kit expects projects to be in the newer "SDK-style" format.

These filenames (`Assembly-CSharp.csproj`, `Assembly-CSharp-Editor.csproj`) strongly suggest this might be a Unity project.

Could you please confirm if this is a Unity project?

*   **If it IS a Unity project:** The recommended approach is usually *not* to manually edit these `.csproj` files. Instead, you should configure Unity to work correctly with VS Code.
    1.  In Unity, go to `Edit` > `Preferences` > `External Tools`.
    2.  Set `External Script Editor` to `Visual Studio Code`.
    3.  Ensure the "Visual Studio Code Editor" package is installed in Unity's Package Manager (`Window` > `Package Manager`).
    4.  In Unity, go to `Assets` > `Open C# Project`. This should regenerate the project and solution files in a format VS Code can understand better.
    5.  You might also need to ensure the [.NET SDK](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/en-us/download) and the [C# Dev Kit extension](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ms-dotnettools.csdevkit) are correctly installed for VS Code.

*   **If it is NOT a Unity project:** You would need to manually convert the `.csproj` files to the SDK style. This involves changing the XML structure significantly. If this is the case, please add the contents of `C:\Users\tommy\My project\Assembly-CSharp-Editor.csproj` and `C:\Users\tommy\My project\Assembly-CSharp.csproj` to the chat, and I can guide you through the conversion process.

Let me know if it's a Unity project or not, and we can proceed from there. I cannot propose specific file edits until I have this information and potentially the file contents.

> Tokens: 2.6k sent, 462 received.  

#### yes it is a unity project, i planned to use vs code as my ide instead of unity editor  

Okay, I understand. It's common to use VS Code as the script editor for Unity projects. However, it's important to clarify that VS Code acts as an *external editor* for the C# scripts, while the Unity Editor itself still manages the overall project structure, assets, and crucially, the generation of the `.sln` and `.csproj` files that VS Code uses to understand the project.

The errors you're seeing mean that Unity is currently generating those `.csproj` files in an older format that the modern VS Code C# Dev Kit doesn't support. **Manually editing these `.csproj` files to convert them to the SDK style is generally not the correct solution for Unity projects**, because Unity will often regenerate and overwrite them, undoing your changes.

Instead, you need to configure Unity to generate the project files correctly for VS Code and ensure the necessary tools are installed:

1.  **Install/Update Necessary Tools:**
    *   Make sure you have a recent version of the [.NET SDK](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/en-us/download) installed.
    *   In VS Code, ensure you have the [C# Dev Kit extension](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ms-dotnettools.csdevkit) installed.
    *   Consider installing the [Unity extension for Visual Studio Code](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=VisualStudioToolsForUnity.vstuc) as well, which provides debugging and other Unity-specific features.

2.  **Configure Unity:**
    *

Okay, I understand. It's common to use VS Code as the script editor for Unity projects. However, it's important to clarify that VS Code acts as an *external editor* for the C# scripts, while the Unity Editor itself still manages the overall project structure, assets, and crucially, the generation of the `.sln` and `.csproj` files.

The errors you're seeing mean that Unity is currently generating those `.csproj` files in an older format that the modern VS Code C# Dev Kit doesn't support. **You should not manually edit these `.csproj` files to try and fix this.** Unity will likely overwrite your changes the next time it synchronizes or rebuilds the project files.

Instead, you need to configure Unity to generate the files correctly for VS Code. Please follow these steps *within the Unity Editor*:

1.  **Install/Verify VS Code Editor Package:**
    *   In Unity, go to `Window` > `Package Manager`.
    *   Make sure "Packages: In Project" or "Packages: Unity Registry" is selected.
    *   Search for `Visual Studio Code Editor`. If it's not installed, install it. If it is installed, ensure it's up to date.

2.  **Set VS Code as External Editor:**
    *   In Unity, go to `Edit` > `Preferences`.
    *   Select the `External Tools` tab.
    *   In the `External Script Editor` dropdown, select `Visual Studio Code`. If it's not listed, you might need to browse for the `Code.exe` executable.

3.  **Regenerate Project Files:**
    *   Still in `Edit` > `Preferences` > `External Tools`, click the `Regenerate project files` button.
    *   Alternatively, you can trigger this by going to `Assets` > `Open C# Project` in the Unity menu bar.

4.  **Ensure C# Dev Kit and .NET SDK:**
    *   Make sure you have the [.NET SDK](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/en-us/download) installed on your system (usually the latest LTS version is recommended).
    *   Ensure the [C# Dev Kit extension](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ms-dotnettools.csdevkit) is installed in VS Code. You might also benefit from the [Unity extension for VS Code](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=VisualStudioToolsForUnity.vstuc) by Microsoft, although the C# Dev Kit is the one causing the specific error you saw.

After performing these steps in Unity, close VS Code if it's open, and then try opening the C# project again either from Unity (`Assets` > `Open C# Project`) or by opening the project folder directly in VS Code. The errors related to the unsupported project format should be resolved because Unity should now generate compatible `.csproj` files.

I will not provide `SEARCH/REPLACE` blocks because modifying these specific files directly is not the correct solution for Unity projects. The fix needs to happen within the Unity Editor's configuration.
